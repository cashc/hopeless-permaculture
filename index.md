Why "hopeless"? Hopelessness to me is a state of being at peace with our current situation. Our current situation has a lot of problems with it (war, genocide, depression, fear-based thinking, etc.), but those problems are not solved with despair, overwhelm, or desire to be rid of them. They are solved best by first relaxing with them- seeing them for what they are and not trying to change them. Only once we can be with our struggles, can we love them. And love is the answer.

*Hopeless*: I learned the term from Pema Chödrön's book, "When Things Fall Apart"

By relaxing with the hopelessness of our situation and detaching from outcome, we open ourselves and our homes up to the most wonderful possibilities.
